# Green Hydrogen Analysis Repository

The repository is for our research on the development and future cost trajectory of green hydrogen. This repository hosts both the publication detailing our findings and an interactive dashboard that allows for a deeper exploration of the data and projections.

### Abstract

A sustainable future hydrogen economy is critically dependent on the development of green hydrogen, shifting away from grey hydrogen. This transition is currently hindered by high production costs of green hydrogen. Our study focuses on predicting the cost trajectory of alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, key technologies in green hydrogen production. We consider factors such as ongoing research and development (R&D), scale effects, and experiential learning, and their impact on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) projections.

Key Findings:
- Electrolyzer capital costs are projected to decrease significantly by 2050, with optimistic estimates at 88 USD/kW for alkaline and 60 USD/kW for PEM, and pessimistic estimates at 388 USD/kW and 286 USD/kW, respectively.
- PEM electrolyzers are likely to dominate the market.
- The global LCOH of green hydrogen is expected to fall below 5 USD/kg for solar, onshore, and offshore wind energy sources by 2030 under both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.
- Implementation of financial strategies and regulations, such as a hydrogen/carbon credit system, a minimum retail price for oxygen, a carbon tax, and a contract-for-difference scheme, could significantly accelerate the transition to a green hydrogen economy.
